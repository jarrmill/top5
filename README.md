# Hire Us

Hire us is a platform that allows applicants to quickly generate resumes and for recruiters to quickly search submitted resumes based on their own criteria.

## Motivation
To optimize the hiring process for applicants and recruiters.

- The Issue:
  - For Applicants: 
    - Resume creation is a time consuming and can be simplified to focus on whatâ€™s important, the content not the styling. 
  - For Recruiters: 
    - Recruiters face an influx of resumes from qualified and unqualified candidates which takes hours upon hours to parse.
- Our solution:
  - For Applicants: 
    - Standard JSON-based resume which allows for automatically created and formatted resumes which get stored in the Yuuvis API. This allows applicants to quickly create the content of their resume and share it with all the recruiters on the platform.
  - For Recruiters: 
    - Recruiters are able to search resumes with Yuuvis's API to find resumes that match the criteria they are searching for. This allows recrutiers to reach out to qualified candidates rather than candidates reaching out to recruiters.
